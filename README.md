<h3>First Unity game</h3>

In this project i used Unity and it's libraries
The logic of this game is pretty simple. 
I have a background image that makes us feel that we are flying forward. In reality,
we are not changing our position. You can control the position of your spaceship using axes. 
if spaceship flies all the way through the left or the right corner - it appears at the opposite side of monitor with same horizontal coordinates. 
You can change your weapon, by pressing "R" button. You are able to use 3 powerups 
and one restoring hp power up , that has a change of dropping from the enemies.
Enemies have 1 hit point . player have 3 hit points. Enemies spawns randomly in the top of the scrreen and go all the way down, shooting us in procces. If an enemy wasn't destroyed he spawns randomly at the top of the screen in addition to new automaticaly spawned enemy. It makes our games more challenging.
I realised saving the progress in the binarry file, so you can have your highscore even after restarting of your game.
I have main menu and pause menu.

Actually i also had boss, that apered after killing n amount of enemies, 
controllers for mobile devices and had those bugs fixed, but somehow 
i lost this version due to i was not using git hub :'( .
